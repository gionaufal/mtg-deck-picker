# MTG Deck Picker

This is a work in progress project to find which top decks from [MTG Goldfish's Standard list](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/standard/full#paper) you can build with the cards you already have.

Given a list of cards in `cards.txt`, the app compares your cards with the cards from these top decks, and tells you which and how many cards you are lacking to complete the deck. 

### TODO:
- Encapsulate it in a CLI
- Create a web interface (probably using Phoenix)
- Publish and deploy
